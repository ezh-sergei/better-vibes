# Backend Development Workflow

<workflow_lookup>

- Use `make help` at the project root to discover core service and maintenance targets.
- Use `make help` in `backend/` to discover backend quality, testing, and ops targets.
- Consult `docs/memory-bank/systemOperations.md` for authoritative workflows and any environment caveats.

</workflow_lookup>

<execution_policies>

- Prefer Make targets over invoking scripts directly; avoid hard-coded commands in rule invocations.
- Do not run destructive operations (db trims/resets, clear-all cache, mass deletes); only the user may execute such commands.
- Follow command execution rules in `agent.mdc` (correct working directory, background for long-running tasks, no pagers forced).

</execution_policies>

<quality_checks>

- Before proposing backend code changes, ensure formatting and types are clean via the appropriate Make target (see `make help`).
- After edits, run a lightweight type check via the backend Make target when applicable.
- Use ops docs for any specialized flows (DB migrations, cache management, CI parity).

</quality_checks>
